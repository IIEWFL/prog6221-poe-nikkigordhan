<h4> The application does the following: </h4>
<p> 1. The user shall be able to enter the details for multiple recipes: </br>
	a. The number of ingredients.</br>

	d. For each step: a description of what the user should do. </p>
<p> 2.  The software shall display the full recipe, including the ingredients, steps and total calories, in a neat format to the user. </br> </p>
<p> 3. The user shall be able to request that the recipe is scaled by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double) or 3 (triple). All the ingredient quantities shall be changed accordingly when the recipe is displayed. For example, our one tablespoon of sugar will become two tablespoons of sugar if the factor is 2. </br> </p>
<p> 4. The user can request that the quantities be reset to the original values. </br> </p>
<p> 5. The user shall be able to clear all the data to enter a new recipe.  </br> </p>
